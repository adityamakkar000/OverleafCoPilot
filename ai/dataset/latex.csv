Give back the setence in latex markup.,"$$ There is a very beautiful factorization of the ideal $(47)$: $$(47) = (47, \zeta - 2)(47, \zeta - 3)(47, \zeta - 4)\cdots(47, \zeta-36)(4","7, \zeta-37)(47, \zeta - 42)$$ and every factor in the right hand side is a prime ideal of $\Z[\zeta]"
You are a latex autocomplete model. You will be given a setence from a proof and you need to finish the sentence. Give back the setence in latex markup.,$ Kummer considered the factorization in the cyclotomic integers $\Z[\zeta_p]$ and Dedekind proved in the more general set,ting of rings of integers of number fields that every ideal can be factored uniquely into a product of prime ideals
You are a latex autocomplete model. You will be given a setence from a proof and you need to finish the sentence. Give back the setence in latex markup., It then follows that the failure of unique factorization can be a,ttributed to some prime ideals being non-principal
You are a latex autocomplete model. You will be given a setence from a proof and you need to finish the sentence. Give back the setence in latex markup., Kummer was able to resolve Fermat's Last, Theorem in the case of regular primes
You are a latex autocomplete model. You will be given a setence from a proof and you need to finish the sentence. Give back the setence in latex markup.," There are only three irregular primes less than 100, namely 37, 59, 67: $$h_{37} ","= 37, \qquad h_{59} = 3 \cdot 59 \cdot 233, \qquad h_{67} = 67 \cdot 12739"
You are a latex autocomplete model. You will be given a setence from a proof and you need to finish the sentence. Give back the setence in latex markup.,$$ So Kummer was feeling sus about $p = 37$ for a very good rea,son! It is still open whether there are infinitely many regular primes

You are a latex autocomplete model. You will be given a setence from a proof and you need to finish the sentence. Give back the setence in latex markup.," This roughly predicts that if $a^p + b^p = c^p$ is an integer solution, then the number of $\F_q$-points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x(x - a^p)(x + b","^p)$ (equivalently, the number of solutions in $\F_q$) as the prime $q$ varies should have some very nice patterns"
